# Django Blog

This repo serves as evidence of my Django progression. Specifically, it should serve as proof of my personal learning from *Django 3 By Example* by Antonio Mel√©.
<br>
Specifically, what I learnt here was:
<ul>
<li> Creating Django..
    <ul>
    <li> Projects
    <li> Apps
    <li> Migrations
    <li> Models
    <li> Views
    <li> Forms
    <li> Templates
    <li> Static files
    <li> Sitemaps
    <li> RSS Feeds
    </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li> I also learnt about..
    <ul>
    <li> Django ORM
    <li> Postgres in Django
    <li> Taggit and the psycopg2 plugins
    </ul>
</ul>

Many other things were learnt during this first chapter. I would note the tutorial did not implement any form of user registration and as such the application is not worthy for full publishing, however user management will be learnt next and may be implemented in the future.
